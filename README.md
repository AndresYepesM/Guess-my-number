Guess my number with the powerfull javascript
This project i made it with javascript course on udemy, this part of the course we put on practice all what we learn about the powerful javascript, from the fundamentals of javascript to how to manipulate dom using javascript and querrys, the project is really simple, just we need to declare a random number between 1 and 20, and using if-else statements to compare the input with the random number, if the input is equal random number you win, but if the input is too high or too low you loss one point of the total score, with all this the game  is functional, only you need is to guess which number is it, the game also give you information if it is too high or low from the random number, and if you lower your score down to 0 you lose the game.
